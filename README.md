# Software-Engineering-Fall-2018-
Group Project for the Software Engineering course at Tufts University Fall 2018

This project is a Smart Health App developed by our group of 5.

My role in the group was the Project Manager as well as developer for the Diet class. This repo consists of my work with the following exceptions:
  - Revision and edits to the SRS by various group members
  - Portions of MenuActivity:main interface that allows for communication between all the classes
Add, Update, Delete, and View Info button functions in MenuActivity.java were written by me as part of the Diet class.
